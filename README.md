# Exposition-Date
"""
This is a program that is for inputting date ideas, then having the program select one at random for you
and your significant other to go on. It has a priority system where cheaper dates occur more often, and
more expensive dates occur less often. This is a first time project for members of the Taylor 2 community,
and it is made by two mechanical engineering majors with limited programming knowledge.
